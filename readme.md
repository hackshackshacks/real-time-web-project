# Imageguess
Imageguess is an online multiplayer game. The website shows an image and the goal is to guess what words the other players associate with this image. For example: Players might associate a picture of the beach with summer. If multiple players guess 'Summer' they will earn points based on the amount of other players with the same guess. A leaderboard tracks the scoreline.
